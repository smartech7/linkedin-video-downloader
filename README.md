## Prerequisites

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

    $ pip --no-cache-dir install llvd

If you have multiple versions of python installed in your system, use **pip3** instead.

## Example

```cli

    $ llvd --help
    $ llvd -c "course-slug" -r 720

```

## Windows Users

When you get `'llvd' is not recognized as an internal or external command` after successfully installing `llvd`, run `python3 -m llvd <flags>`

## How to find the course slug ?

- Click on the course
- Copy the slug next to learning in the URL `https://www.linkedin.com/learning/l-essentiel-d-asp-dot-net-core-pour-dot-net-5`, in this example the course slug is `l-essentiel-d-asp-dot-net-core-pour-dot-net-5`

## Cookie-based authentication

- 1.  Click on the options in the google chrome (top right with 3 vertical dots).
- 2.  After this, click on more tools followed by Developer Tools (you can also reach here by using the keyboard combination — ctrl+shift+I).

- 3.  Now once you’ve gained access to the developer tools, navigate to the Application tab, and copy the value of two cookies from there named li_at and JSESSIONID respectively.

- 3.  create a cookies.txt file to a place you want to download your courses then paste in the values of li_at and JSESSIONID as shown below.

#### Example (`cookies.txt`)

```sh
li_at=xxxxx
JSESSIONID="ajax:xxxxxx"
```

```cli

    $ llvd --help
    $ llvd -c "course-slug" -r 720 --cookies

```

### Download the course with subtitles

Use the `--caption` flag to download videos with subtitles

```cli

    $ llvd -c "course-slug" -r 720 --caption
```

or

```cli

    $ llvd -c "course-slug" -r 720 -ca
```
